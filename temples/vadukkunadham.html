            <h3 >•	•	History: The temple is believed to have been built in the 8th or 9th century AD, although there is no clear historical record of its origin. It has undergone several renovations and expansions over the centuries.
                •	Architecture: The temple is built in the traditional Kerala style of architecture, with a central shrine surrounded by a large rectangular courtyard. The main shrine is dedicated to Lord Shiva and contains a Shivalinga, a symbol of the god. The temple also has several smaller shrines dedicated to other deities.
                •	Location: The temple is located in the heart of Thrissur city, on a small hill called Thekkinkadu Maidan. It is surrounded by a large circular road called the Swaraj Round, which is a major traffic junction in the city.
                •	Festivals: The temple is famous for its annual festival called Thrissur Pooram, which is held in April or May every year. The festival is a grand celebration of the temple and involves a spectacular procession of decorated elephants, traditional music, and fireworks.
                •	Entry: The temple is open to visitors of all religions and nationalities. However, non-Hindus are not allowed to enter the main shrine. Visitors are required to dress modestly and remove their footwear before entering the temple.
                •	Overall, the Vadakkunnathan Temple is a significant cultural and religious landmark in Kerala, and a must-visit destination for anyone interested in Hinduism and Indian architecture.
                •	In the year 2012 the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has recommended 14 sites, including Vadakkumnathan Temple and palaces, from Kerala to include in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[5] The temple is also the first one among the 108 Shiva Temples in ancient Kerala, established by Parasurama.
                •	According to another version, some sages approached him at the end of the yajna and requested him to give them some secluded land. Parashurama then requested Varuna on their behalf. Varuna gave him a winnow (surpa) and asked him to hurl it into the sea; as he did so, a large area of land was brought from the sea; this region of land that arose from the sea become Kerala. It was then known by the name "Surparaka", from the word, "Surpa" meaning winnow.
                •	For sometime, the lingam remained at Sri Moola Sthana at the foot of a huge banyan tree. The ruler of Cochin Kingdom then decided to shift the lingam to a more appropriate place and construct a temple around it. Arrangements were soon made for the new installation. But there was an initial difficulty. The lingam could not be removed without cutting off a large part of the banyan tree. This created the risk of damaging the lingam due to falling branches. As the ruler and the others remained confounded, the Yogatirippadu came forward with a solution. He lay over the lingam so as to cover it completely with his body and asked the men to cut the tree. The cutting began and to everyone's astonishment, not a single branch of the tree fell anywhere near the deity.
