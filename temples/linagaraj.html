            <h3 >•	•	Details: History: The temple is believed to have been built in the 11th century by the Somavamsi dynasty and has undergone several renovations over the centuries. The temple is a classic example of Kalinga architecture, which is characterized by its pyramid-shaped roofs, ornate carvings, and intricate sculptures.
                •	Architecture: The temple is known for its impressive architecture, which combines elements of the Kalinga and Dravidian styles. The temple is made of red sandstone and is enclosed by a high wall. The main shrine is topped by a 180-foot-high spire, which is visible from a distance. The temple complex also has several smaller shrines dedicated to other deities.
                •	Significance: The Lingaraja Temple is considered to be one of the most important temples in Odisha and is a major pilgrimage site for Hindus. The temple is particularly revered by Shaivites, who worship Lord Shiva as the supreme deity. The temple is also famous for its annual Rath Yatra festival, which is celebrated with great pomp and show.
                •	Festivals: The temple celebrates several festivals throughout the year, including the Mahashivratri, which is the most important festival of the temple. During this festival, thousands of devotees flock to the temple to offer prayers and perform rituals to Lord Shiva. Other important festivals include the Chandan Yatra, which is celebrated during the summer months, and the Rath Yatra, which is celebrated in the month of June or July.
                The Lingaraja temple is the largest temple in Bhubaneswar. The central tower of the temple is 180 ft (55 m) tall. The temple represents the quintessence of the Kalinga architecture and culminating the medieval stages of the architectural tradition at Bhubaneswa. The temple is believed to be built by the kings from the Somavamsi dynasty, with later additions from the Ganga rulers. The temple is built in the Deula style that has four components namely, vimana (structure containing the sanctum), jagamohana (assembly hall), natamandira (festival hall) and bhoga-mandapa (hall of offerings), each increasing in the height to its predecessor. The temple complex has 50 other shrines and is enclosed by a large compound wall.
                Bhubaneswar is called the Ekamra Kshetra as the deity of Lingaraja was originally under a mango tree (Ekamra) as noted in Ekamra Purana, a 13th-century Sanskrit treatise. The temple is active in worship practises, unlike most other temples in Bhubaneswar. The temple has images of Vishnu, possibly because of the rising prominence of Jagannath sect emanating from the Ganga rulers who built the Jagannath Temple in Puri in the 12th century. The central deity of the temple, Lingaraja, is worshipped as Shiva.
                Lingaraja temple is maintained by the Temple Trust Board and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The temple has an average of 6,000 visitors per day and receives lakhs of visitors during festivals. Shivaratri festival is the major festival celebrated in the temple and event during 2012 witnessed 200,000 visitors. The temple compound is not open to non-Hindus, but there is a viewing platform beside the wall offering a good view of the main exteriors. This was originally erected for a visit by Lord Curzon when Viceroy.
