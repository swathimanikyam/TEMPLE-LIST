        <h3 >•	History: The temple is believed to have been built in the 9th century AD by the Chola dynasty, although there are references to the temple in ancient Tamil literature dating back to the 7th century AD. 
            The temple has undergone several renovations and expansions over the centuries.
            •	Architecture: The temple is built in the traditional Dravidian style of architecture, with a towering gopuram (gateway tower) at the entrance. 
            The main shrine is dedicated to Lord Shiva and contains a lingam, a symbol of the god. There are also several other smaller shrines dedicated to other deities.
            •	Location: The temple is located at the base of the Arunachala hill, which is considered a sacred site by Hindus. The town of Thiruvannamalai is located about 160 kilometers southwest of Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu.
            •	Festivals: The temple is famous for its annual Karthigai Deepam festival, which is held in November or December every year. The festival is a grand celebration of Lord Shiva and involves a spectacular procession of a giant lamp lit atop the hill, traditional music, and dancing.
            •	Entry: The temple is open to visitors of all religions and nationalities. Visitors are required to dress modestly and remove their footwear before entering the temple.
            •	Shiva is worshiped as Arunachalesvara or Annamalaiyar, and is represented by the lingam, with his idol referred to as Agni lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Unnamalai Amman or Apithakucha Ambal.[2][3] The presiding deity is revered in the 7th-century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The 9th-century Saiva saint poet Manikkavasagar composed the Tiruvempaavai here.
            •	The temple complex covers 10 hectares, and is one of the largest in India.[4] It houses four gateway towers known as gopurams. The tallest is the eastern tower, with 11 stories and a height of 66 metres (217 ft), making it one of the tallest temple towers in India built by Sevappa Nayakkar (Nayakar dynasty)[4] The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Arunachalesvara and Unnamalai Amman being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls; the most notable is the thousand-pillared hall built during the Vijayanagar period.
            •	The present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty in the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Vijayanagara rulers of the Sangama Dynasty (1336–1485 CE), the Saluva Dynasty and the Tuluva Dynasty (1491–1570 CE). The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu
