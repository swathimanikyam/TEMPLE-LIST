            <h3 >•	•	Detail: History: The temple was built during the 10th century by the Chola dynasty and has undergone several renovations over the centuries. The temple complex is spread over an area of 156 acres, making it one of the largest temple complexes in India.
                •	Architecture: The temple is known for its Dravidian style of architecture and has several gopurams (tower gateways) that are adorned with intricate carvings and sculptures. The main gopuram, which is the entrance to the temple, is 236 feet tall and has 13 levels. The temple also has several mandapams (pillared halls) and shrines dedicated to other deities.
                •	Significance: The Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple is considered to be one of the 108 Divya Desams, which are sacred sites revered by Vaishnavites. The temple is also believed to be one of the eight swayam vyaktha kshetras (self-manifested shrines) of Lord Vishnu. It is said that the temple was built on the spot where Lord Ranganatha appeared in a reclining position on the serpent Adisesha.
                •	Festivals: The temple celebrates several festivals throughout the year, the most important of which is the Vaikunta Ekadasi, which falls in the month of December or January. During this festival, devotees believe that the gates of heaven are opened and that they can attain salvation by visiting the temple.
                •	Visiting hours: The temple is open from 6:00 am to 9:00 pm every day, and visitors are required to adhere to the dress code and other rules and regulations. Non-Hindus are not allowed inside the inner sanctum of the temple.
                •	The Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple is an important pilgrimage site for Vaishnavites and attracts millions of visitors every year. Its stunning architecture, rich history, and religious significance make it a must-visit destination for anyone interested in Indian culture and spirituality.
                •	The temple was first built by the Chola ruler, Dharmavarma. The Kaveri river flood destroyed the temple vimanam, and later, the early Cholas King Killivalavan rebuilt the temple complex as is present today. Beyond the ancient textual history, archaeological evidence such as inscriptions refer to this temple, but these stone inscriptions are from late 1st millennium CE.
                •	The Tamil texts that followed offer various inconsistent legends on how the temple regained the Vishnu icon. According to one found in Koil Oluku, a young girl had vowed to fast till she had seen the icon.[8] She followed the Muslim army as it returned with the loot back to Delhi. There she sneaked into the palace and saw that the Sultan's daughter had fallen in love with the image. The young girl returned to Srirangam and told the priests about what she had seen in Delhi. The priests went with musicians to Delhi, found the icon in capriciously playful possession of the Sultan's daughter, day and night.[8] They sang and danced before the Sultan to return the icon, and he gave it back which upset his daughter. To console the daughter, the Sultan sent in his army again to bring it back, but this time they were not successful.[8] According to other versions, the Muslim daughter followed the icon from Delhi to Srirangam on a horse and still not seeing the idol, gave up her life before the door of the sanctum, symbolizing that love brought back the icon after the war had taken it away.
                •	The temple and its artwork are a subject of numerous different Tamil legends covered in regional Puranic texts. Sriranga Mahathmiyam, for example, is one of the compilation of the temple mythology about its origins.[43] According to it, Brahma was performing austerities during the Samudra Manthana (churning of cosmic ocean), and Srirangam Vimanam emerged as a result. It remained in Satyaloka for ages, was brought to Ayodhya by king Ikshvaku.[1] After Rama, an avatar of Vishnu, had killed the evil demon Ravana, he gave it to King Vibhishana who wanted to be with Rama.[44] When Vibhishana passed through Tiruchi en route to Sri Lanka where he had become the king, the Srirangam Vimanam would not move from the island. So, he gave it to a local king called Dharmavarma, if the king consecrated the Vimanam to face the south cardinal direction eternally, blessing him and Lanka. Hence, it is that the deity (in a reclining posture) faces South, his body aligned to the east-west axis.
