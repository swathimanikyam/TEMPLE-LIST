            <h3 >•	•	History: The temple was built in 1859 by a group of Chettiars, who were Tamil moneylenders and traders in Singapore. It was originally a small shrine dedicated to Lord Murugan, but has since been expanded and renovated several times.
                •	Architecture: The temple is built in the traditional South Indian Dravidian style of architecture, with a towering gopuram (gateway tower) at the entrance. The main shrine is dedicated to Lord Murugan, and there are several other smaller shrines dedicated to other deities, such as Lord Ganesha and Lord Shiva.
                •	Location: The temple is located in the heart of Little India, a vibrant ethnic district in Singapore. It is situated on Tank Road, near several other Hindu temples and cultural attractions.
                •	Festivals: The temple is famous for its annual Thaipusam festival, which is held in January or February every year. The festival is a grand celebration of Lord Murugan and involves a spectacular procession of devotees carrying kavadis (decorated wooden frames) and piercings, traditional music, and dancing.
                •	Entry: The temple is open to visitors of all religions and nationalities. Visitors are required to dress modestly and remove their footwear before entering the temple.
                •	This Shaivite temple, dedicated to the six-faced Lord Subramaniam (Lord Muruga), is at its most active during the festival of Thaipusam, where the procession ends here. It is here, during the annual Thaipusam festival, that hundreds of pilgrims, their bodies pierced by hooks, spears and spiked steel structures called kavadi, end their walk from the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple on Serangoon Road. The act of penance is carried out by devotees in gratitude to Lord Subramanian or Murugan, son of Lord Siva, for granting their prayers of supplication.
                •	Designed in the South Indian style, the temple features elements typical of Chettiar architecture, such as thinnais (raised platforms) at the threshold and 48 glass panels lining the mandapam (prayer hall), which bring to life the different forms of Shiva's mystical dance, the Nataraja (Lord of the Dance).
                •	Hindu temple architecture as the main form of Hindu architecture has many varieties of style, though the basic nature of the Hindu temple remains the same, with the essential feature an inner sanctum, the garbha griha or womb-chamber, where the primary Murti or the image of a deity is housed in a simple bare cell.
