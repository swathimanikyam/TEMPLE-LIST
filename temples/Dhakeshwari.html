            <h3 >•	•	History: The Dhakeshwari Temple is believed to have been built in the 11th century by the Sena dynasty rulers of Bengal. The temple was damaged and rebuilt several times over the centuries, with the current structure dating back to the early 20th century.
                •	Location: The Dhakeshwari Temple is located in the old part of Dhaka, near the Lalbagh Fort and the Buriganga River. The temple is situated on a raised platform and is surrounded by a large courtyard.
                •	Architecture: The Dhakeshwari Temple is built in the traditional Hindu style of architecture, with a tall shikhara or tower at the top. The temple is made of stone and has a number of small shrines and altars inside. The main deity of the temple is the goddess Durga, who is worshipped in various forms.
                •	Festivals: The Dhakeshwari Temple is particularly busy during the Hindu festivals of Durga Puja and Kali Puja, when thousands of devotees visit the temple to offer prayers and participate in rituals. Other important festivals celebrated at the temple include Diwali, Holi, and Navratri.
                •	Visiting: The Dhakeshwari Temple is open to visitors of all faiths, although there are certain restrictions on entry during religious festivals. Visitors are required to remove their shoes before entering the temple, and photography is not allowed inside the sanctum sanctorum.
                The Dhakeshwari (Durga) temple was built in the 12th century by Ballal Sen, a king of the Sena dynasty, and it is said that the city Dhaka was named after the Goddess.[3] The current architectural style of the temple cannot be dated to that period because of the numerous repairs, renovations, and rebuilding which have taken place over time. It is considered an essential part of Dhaka's cultural heritage. Many researchers believe that the temple is also one of the Shakti Peethas, where the jewel from the crown of the Goddess Sati had fallen. For ages, the temple has been held in great importance. The original 900-year-old murti was taken to Kumartuli, Kolkata, West Bengal, India. In 1947, during the partition of India, she was brought to Kolkata from Dhaka with millions of East Bengali (Now Bangladeshi) Hindu refugees. By 1950, the businessman Debendranath Chaudhary built the temple of Goddess in Kumortuli area and established some of the Goddess' property for her daily services. The idol is 1.5 feet tall, has ten arms, mounted on her lion in the form of Katyani Mahishasurmardini 'Durga'. On her two sides are Laxmi, Saraswati, Kartik and Ganesh. A Tiwari family from Azamgarh was appointed by the royal Sena (Sen) dynasty for daily worship of the deity of Dhaka. In 1960, the descendants of that Tiwari family came to Calcutta and were re-appointed, where they still serve the Goddess continuously.
                Current presiding deity here in Dhakeshwari Temple is the replica of the original idol.

                It is widely believed that the Queen, wife of King Bijoy Sen went to Langolbond for bathing. On her way back she gave birth to a son, known to historians as Ballal Sen.[4] After ascending to the throne, Ballal Sen built this temple to glorify his birthplace. Legends say that Ballal Sen once dreamt of the deity covered under the jungle. Ballal Sen uncovered the deity from there and built a temple, named for Dhakeswari. Whatever the legends describe, Hindus consider Dhakeswari to be the presiding deity of Dhaka, which is an incarnation or form of Goddess Durga the Adi Shakti. The idol of Durga is called Dhakeswari .
                In 1996, Dhakeshwari Temple was renamed Dhakeshwari Jatiya Mandir (National Temple) reflecting its position as the centre of Hindu culture and worship in Bangladesh.[5] This was the culmination of a major campaign by Bangladeshi Hindu groups who had been demanding official recognition for the primary Hindu place of worship following the declaration of Islam as the state religion in 1988. As a result, the flag of Bangladesh is hoisted every morning outside the main temple premises, and it follows the National Flag Code rules such as rendering half-mast on nationally declared days of mourning.
                As is the practice in other leading religious places of worship in Bangladesh, day-long prayers are common practice during important national holidays such as Independence Day, Language Martyrs' Day, Victory Day and birth and death anniversaries of former leaders such as Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Ziaur Rahman.
